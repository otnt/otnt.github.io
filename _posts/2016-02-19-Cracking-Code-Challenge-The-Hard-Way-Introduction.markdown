> This blog series are to help new grads like me to prepare algorithm interview/tech interview. These posts focus on common useful data structures, algorithms, test strategies and some tricks to help you to crack code challenge!

## Situation at tech industry is not that bad

Yes, many said another tech bubble is bursting. Twitter fired around 8 percent of their employees, much are from engineer and product teams[1]. LinkedIn's value drop by almost half (nearly 11 billions) in one single night[2]. STEM Opt extension is under possibility to be cut[3].

But, as far as I have observed, the situation is not that bad. Tech companies still pay large amount of dollars to provide flights and hotels for interviewees. The head counts of large tech companies(e.g. FLAG) may be reduced but overall head counts, including great number of emerging small companies, is still amazingly high. New Grads are still getting decent salaries and bonus.

## Yet you need to be well-prepared

I have no dare neither experience to foretell the future of computer science industry. But the truth is competition has significantly raised during these years. Even five years ago, the famous [Leetcode.com](leetcode.com) (a coding practice platform) has no more than one hundred problems and a student mastering all these solutions would be very likely to be hired by good tech companies. But the website has more than three hundred problems now (334 on Feb 19th 2016) and one not only need to solve these problems but is also required to solve them bug-freely. 

It is hard. It is the reality.

## What's this blog series is?

The motivation for this series is to help young CS students, especially newbies, to better prepare frequent technical questions. 

There are several common solution to all these questions, and each solution shows, given constraints or simplification of real-world scenario, how a software engineer thinks from a programmer's perspective, i.e. tradeoff among space and time complexity or tradeoff among development complexity and algorithm efficiency etc.

In this series, you would hopefully learn when and how to use some most useful data structures and algorithms, the difference and tradeoff among these data structures and algorithms, how to implement some of these data structures, and how to analyze time and space tradeoff among these data structures and algorithms.

## What this blog series is NOT?

I definitely absolutely totally do not want you to memorize the solutions here. Surely there are some patterns/templates that maybe helpful if you remember them. But the solution is based on an deep understanding of all those data structures and algorithms and a little bit of tricks. 

Remember that memorizing a solution always do no good to your interview.
