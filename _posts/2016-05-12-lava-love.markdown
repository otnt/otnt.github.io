过去的一周，和我生命中的奇迹--饼妹--一起在甘肃南部游玩。期间看了这个微电影，非常喜欢尤克里里欢快的配乐，可爱的卡通形象，和优美的歌词。在此将个人听译的歌词分享给大家。

歌词：

A long long time ago, there was a volcano

Living all alone in the middle of the sea

He sat high above his span, watching all the couples play

And wishing that, he had some one too

And from his lava came this song of hope that he sang out love everyday for years and years

[Volcano:]

I have a dream. 

I hope it will come true. 

You are here with me, and I'm here with you.

I wish that the earth see the sky up above, will send me someone to lava
 
Years of singing all alone, turn his lava into stone

** until he was on the green extinction?

But little did he know that living in the sea below

One other volcano was listening to his song

Everyday she heard this too

Her lava grew and grew

Because she believed his song was made for her

Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea

As he sang his song of hope for the last time
 
[Volcano:]

I have a dream. 

I hope it will come true. 

You are here with me, and I'm here with you.

I wish that the earth see the sky up above, will send me someone to lava

Rising from the sea below stood the lovely volcano

Looking all around but she could not see him

He tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone

** but with no lava has some one so gone

He felt the sea with his tears

And watched his dream disappear

Yet she remembered what his song meant to her

[Volcano:]

I have a dream. 

I hope it will come true. 

You are here with me, and I'm here with you.

I wish that the earth see the sky up above, will send me someone to lava

Oh they were so happy

To finally meet above the sea

All together now their lava grew and grew

No longer are they all alone

** with the loha? as their new home? 

And when we visited down, this is what  they sing
  
[Volcanos together:]

I have a dream. 

I hope it will come true. 

Now you grow old with me, and I'll grow old with you.

We thank the earth till the sky we've been to

I lava you

I lava you

I lava you

[End]
