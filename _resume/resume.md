### Work Experience

**Google Ads & Commerce Payment Team (SDE Intern)** 05 - 08/2016

- Prevented and alerted abnormal payments and found ~10 bugs in current payment system by analyzing complex payment business logic and one year’s historical payment data and building a validation and monitor framework.
- Tested the monitor framework on production data (~10TB) using FlumeJava (Google’s internal data processing framework).
~10K lines of code submitted. Exceed expectation review (mid term).

**High Performance Web Server Design (Cloud Computing Teaching Assistant)** 10 - 12/2016

- Developed multiple ETL processes on 1TB data with $10 budget using MapReduce and Spark framework.
Built a read-only web service handling ~8K RPS from ~20M records(~70G data) with $1/hour budget on AWS, by fine-tuning HBase database, data compression, data balance and well-designed schema etc.
- Built a read/write mixed web service handling ~10K RPS from ~20G data with $1/hour budget on AWS, by fine-tuning MySQL database, batching technique and well-designed concurrency model etc.
- Identified and eliminated performance bottlenecks, achieving ~10x higher throughput compared with naive design, with tracing tools(perf), monitoring tools(top, vmstat, sar, Ganglia), visualization tools (flame graph) etc.
