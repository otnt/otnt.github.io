<p>Hi, welcome to my tech blog, a place I share experience, tricks and thoughts about software technology.</p>
<p>I hold a Bachelor degree in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Top 5 in China) and a Master degree in Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). <a href="{{ "/resume" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">My resume is here</a>.</p>
<p>During the years I’ve been interacted with multiple software areas, including</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>algorithm/math heavy areas</strong>: machine learning or computer vision (most of my last two years in bachelor study was on computer vision),</li>
	<li><strong>web and mobile applications</strong>: played with some projects during Hackathons and a start-up project,</li>
	<li><strong>high level system</strong>: designed simple distributed system in Go, and web service in Java,</li>
	<li><strong>low-medium level system</strong>: implemented network library, SSD block mapping layer,</li>
	<li><strong>hardware level system</strong>: some on single chip machines handling small tasks, some on FPGA for real-time system.</li>
</ol>
<p>While every experience provides some level of fun and challenge, I found myself most enjoyed when I</p>
<ol>
	<li>need to think hard to make sure robustness, e.g. malformed input, concurrency issue, crash of other component(s),<ul>
			<li>An example is my network project: every system call may fail, network delays are unpredictable, bit error is rare but exists, peer crash happens, insufficient memory, malformed requests etc.</li></ul></li>
	<li>need to think hard to make system flexible and modular, in order for easy testing, extension, and potential performance improvement,<ul>
			<li>An example is my hybrid file system project, where I implemented a file system backed by  local and cloud storage with smart de-duplication technique and basic caching policy. It fits well in a layered design and by using a five layered model, I could unit testing each component and each layer is flexible enough to be enhanced separately.</li></ul></li>
	<li>need to figure out performance bottlenecks.<ul>
			<li>An example is my high performance web server project, where I implemented web services handling ~10K requests/second with limited resource. As a result I need to figure out performance bottlenecks, and extract as much power from the machine as possible.</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Another point of view is I’m more intrigued when learning how to handle problems with a practical, engineered or empirical way than in an algorithm and theory focused way. This is not saying algorithm/theory is not important — each software area has some principles that is fundamentally important, and math is still the most inexpensive tool to estimate a system performance — but just I personally enjoy the tradeoff, the complex and unpredictability of system design.</p>
<p>My career goal is to become a system architect. Let's all keep calm and move on!</p>
