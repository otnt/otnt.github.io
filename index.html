#Code Challenge the Hard Way

So it is January 2016. Twitter fired pretty much amount of their employees. Cornell, Carnegie Mellon has restricted Non-CS student to take CS courses. STEM Opt extension is under possibility to be cut.

So it is winter. A blizzard and cold spell that maybe the strongest in this century.

Computer science is still a young industry. Years ago it is the best industry for many foreigners to land a decent job. Yet the competition has significantly raised during these years. Even five years ago, the famous [Leetcode.com][leetcode.com] has no more than one hundred problems and a student mastering these solutions would be hired by good company including FLAG. But the website has more than three hundred problems now and one not only need to solve these problems but is also required to solve them bug-freely. 

It is hard. But it is America. It is reality.

The motivation for this series is to help young CS students, especially those who have not much programming experience but want to prepare for a software engineer position, to better handle frequent technical questions.

Each article in this series contains three parts (a tentative plan).
Part A: The basic data structure or method as a topic.
Part B: Let's discussion some typical code challenge.
Part C(possibly): Some advanced data structure or optimization method.

Here is links for all articles in the series (continuously adding more).
: Two pointers
: Sliding Stream and Sliding Window Problem
: Dynamic Programming
